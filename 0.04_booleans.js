//Create three booleans about yourself
console.log(true);
console.log(true);
console.log(false);

//create three booleans and make them two truths and a lie
console.log("I am short is " + true);
console.log("I am cool is " + true);
console.log("I am overweight is " + false);

//two booleans could be
console.log("I am short is " + true + " " + "I am tall is " + false);

//It is okay to combine booleans
